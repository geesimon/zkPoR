# zkPoR: Server

This server is supposed to be run by CEX internally to update smart contract per user balance changes.

# How to build
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

# How to run 
- Run
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
- Update private and public keys settings in .env
- Run
```sh
npm run start
```

# Access Points
- `/account/:id`(GET): retrieve account info (balance and Merkle path)
- `/account` (POST): add new account
- `/account` (PUT): update account
- `/totalbalances`(GET): retrieve accumulated balances for all users
- `/oraclebalances`(GET): retrieve oracle balances (updated by Oracle)
- `/oraclebalances`(PUT): update oracle balances (called by Oracle)

# Please Note
Current implementation is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using zkApp to update user account balance. Thus, we donâ€™t spend time working on securing the server access, making the server more reliable and scalable. For production usage, a re-architecture is needed.
